# Autonomous Progress

Durable handoff for the autonomous Syllo product-engineering routine. Read this
first; `.remember/current.md` is the detailed narrative log this summarizes
(read it for full root-cause writeups and prior-session detail).

_Last updated: 2026-07-21, session on branch `claude/determined-thompson-8ideqq`
(continuing PR #37 from `claude/determined-thompson-32ricp`)._

## Latest session (`claude/determined-thompson-8ideqq`) — PR #37 finished, reviewed, merged

Picked up where the prior session left off: PR #37 (`is_annual` course atomic
multi-semester placement fix) was open with a Codex review loop already 9
rounds deep. Re-synced the assigned branch to `ui/frontend-modernization` HEAD
first (this session was, again, provisioned from a stale intermediate point
in history rather than the branch tip — same recurring provisioning issue
prior sessions have had to correct each time).

Round 10 Codex review on commit `b94cad3` left 2 unresolved findings, both
fixed in commit `7a26bc9`:
- **P1**: when a partially-placed annual course's missing span can't legally
  accept it (e.g. the target semester is already at/over `HARD_LOAD_CAP`),
  the repair correctly rejects, but the loop then fell through to the normal
  search/STOP path with the annual course still split — and the
  `generate-plan.ts` response only turned `overloadGate`/`disallowedGate`
  findings into `blocked`, so this returned `blocked:false` even though
  `validateCandidate()` internally knew the plan was invalid. Fixed with a
  new `annualCompletenessGate()`, mirroring the existing `disallowedGate`
  pattern (same one issue #25 Finding #1 established): re-derives
  `incompleteAnnualCourseIds` against the FINAL placed set and turns an
  unrepaired split into a real blocking error.
- **P2**: `placedHours()` only deduplicated annual-hour double-counting via
  the older `root_course_id`+`count_hours_once` pairing (two distinct ids).
  The newer atomic `is_annual`/`spans_semesters` mechanism this PR added
  places the SAME id into multiple `state.semesters` entries — a board
  omitting the optional `count_hours_once`/`root_course_id` metadata had its
  hours counted once per occurrence (8h instead of 4h). Fixed by
  deduplicating on the course id itself first.

Round 11 Codex review on `7a26bc9` surfaced one more (fixed in `7546c21`):
`toProposal()`'s moves-diff reported a repaired annual span as
`{from: <original semester>, to: <new semester>}` even though the course
still occupied the original semester — any consumer applying `moves`
literally could undo the just-completed atomic placement. Fixed: a move's
`from` is only set when the course no longer occupies ANY of its original
semesters in the final state; otherwise `from: null` (an addition, not a
relocation).

Round 12 Codex review on `7546c21`: **clean, no further findings.** CI 3/3
green, all 13 review threads resolved with evidence, base still current.
**Merged** (`c325eb6`, normal merge commit) — 12 real Codex review rounds
across the PR's full lifetime (this session handled rounds 10–12), every
finding fixed with a regression test, none dismissed.

Full API suite at merge: **1237/1237 tests, 81/81 suites**, zero
regressions. `tsc --noEmit` clean. New fixture:
`data/boards/test_program_annual_course_blocked_2027.json` (an annual course
whose missing span is legally unrepairable — pinned to a fixed 23h mandatory
course, breaching the 26h hard cap if completed).

Re-confirmed production state (Vercel API): **unchanged from prior
sessions** — still stale at `26500d4` (`Merge pull request #11`), `live:
false`, no git integration on the project, same sandbox blocker (no Vercel
CLI credentials, `deploy_to_vercel` MCP deliberately avoided — see Blockers).
Now **7** merged, tested, Codex-reviewed fixes are unshipped to real users:
PR #12, #13, #27, #31, #32, #34, and now **#37**.

## Prior session (`claude/determined-thompson-fewuif`) — audit only, no new code

Ran the standing start-of-session audit (production health, open PRs/branches,
Codex/CI state, issues, this doc). Findings below; deliberately took no
autonomous action beyond one safe docs merge, since every substantive item
found is already a fully-diagnosed, open human decision from a prior session
— re-investigating them found nothing new to add.

- **Production confirmed healthy, no incident.** Vercel `tau-course-planner`
  (`prj_8Wn5yOXOxvOSfB6pZ3XVAnf8Y21e`) latest deployment `READY`, zero runtime
  errors in the last 24h. Still stale at `26500d4` ("Merge PR #11") — confirmed
  again via the Vercel API — now missing PR #12/#13/#27/#31/#32/#34, i.e. **6**
  merged, tested, Codex-reviewed fixes including the P0 hard-avoid gate
  (issue #25 Finding #1, PR #27) are unshipped to real users. Also confirmed
  via `get_project` on both Vercel projects: neither `tau-course-planner` nor
  `web` has a linked git repo, so there genuinely is no push-to-deploy path —
  this isn't a missing-secret problem, it's an unmade infra decision (also
  ties into issue #18's canonical-project question).
- **Issue #25 re-checked end to end**: Findings #1 (P0), #2 (High), #3
  (Medium-High) are all confirmed fixed and merged (PR #27/#31/#32) per the
  issue's own comment thread — the issue's top-level body is just stale (still
  describes #1 as unfixed; the comments tell the real story). Only #4
  (`GOAL_STACK` over-allocation, needs a design decision) and #5 (low severity,
  not exploitable) remain open. **No live P0 in the Agent today.**
- **PR #35 merged** (`2b74fd0`) — pure `.remember/current.md` +
  `AUTONOMOUS_PROGRESS.md` correction recording PR #34's already-merged state
  (independently verified accurate against the real merge and diff before
  merging). CI was 3/3 green; no functional change, so merged without waiting
  on a Codex round for this one docs-only PR.
- **PR #14/#15 (Decision capability) left untouched** — correctly still held
  per issue #18's D-milestone-stacking finding; nothing new to add.
- Did **not** attempt a production deploy via the MCP `deploy_to_vercel` tool
  (now available in this session's toolset, wasn't in prior sessions'). Not
  using it because (a) it uploads a raw file tree with no git linkage,
  permanently breaking `gitCommitSha` traceability for every future
  deployment inspection, same risk prior sessions flagged, and (b) it
  wouldn't even resolve the real open question — *which* of the two Vercel
  projects should be canonical is still undecided (issue #18). Deploying to
  the wrong/undecided target, or via a lossy mechanism, is a harder-to-reverse
  mistake than staying stale one more session. Flagging this explicitly as a
  human decision point rather than guessing.

## Branch / release state

- **Canonical development branch:** `ui/frontend-modernization` (transitional —
  `main` is ~190 commits behind it and contains nothing `ui/frontend-modernization`
  doesn't; full reconciliation to make `main` canonical again is NOT done —
  see "Blockers"). This session's assigned branch was, again, provisioned from
  stale `main` by default — reset to `ui/frontend-modernization` HEAD before
  starting, same recurring mistake every session so far has had to correct.
- **Production branch / deploy mechanism:** Vercel project `tau-course-planner`
  (prod domain `tau-course-planner.vercel.app`). **Deploys are one-off local
  `vercel --prod` CLI invocations, not Git-integration-driven** — confirmed via
  the Vercel API (every deployment's `source` is `"cli"`). No branch auto-deploys
  on push.
- **Production commit:** still `26500d4` ("Merge PR #11", 2026-07-19) as of this
  writing — re-confirmed directly via the Vercel API this session (latest
  `tau-course-planner` deployment, `dpl_HJZTB8zqondbwuSnHx6TveggoPVg`, `target:
  production`, unchanged since last session's check). **Stale** — missing PR
  #12/#13 (infra), #27/#31/#32 (issue #25 Findings #1–#3), and now #34 (issue
  #28, this session, merged). No deploy has happened since this was first
  flagged (3+ sessions ago).
- **Deploy blocker:** no session so far (including this one) has had Vercel CLI
  credentials in its sandbox (`vercel login` has no reachable network path).
  Deploying via the MCP `deploy_to_vercel` tool was deliberately avoided — it
  uploads a raw file tree with no git linkage, breaking every existing
  deployment's `gitCommitSha` traceability. **A human (or a session with real
  Vercel CLI access) needs to run a production deploy from `ui/frontend-modernization`
  HEAD.** Flagged repeatedly in issue #18, unresolved across at least 3 sessions.

## This session's milestones (in order)

1. Reset assigned branch from stale `main` to `ui/frontend-modernization` HEAD
   (recurring, see above).
2. Requested fresh Codex review on the two docs-only PRs left open from the
   prior session:
   - **PR #30 closed without merging** — its content (Finding #2 "needs a
     product decision") was superseded the same day by PR #31 actually
     shipping that fix, and it had a real git conflict against the current
     base. Closed with an explanation; the analysis it preserved is still on
     record in issue #25's comment thread.
   - **PR #33 merged** (`8ad6eee`) — Codex-clean on its final commit
     (`13a8017`, which itself already fixed the one prior Codex finding about
     a rolling-three compliance-claim error).
3. **PR #34 merged** (`19cb1e3`) — issue #28 (P2, deferred from PR #27's Codex
   review): client-side stale `blocked`/`overloadBlocked` signal in
   `semester_board_viewer.html` after `applyExplicitAvoidPostFilterLocal`
   locally resolves a disallowed-placement error the server flagged. Fix: new
   pure `resolveStaleDisallowedBlockLocal()`, mirrors the existing
   `hardOverloadRemains` re-check pattern. **2 rounds of real Codex findings
   fixed**, not rubber-stamped:
   - Round 1: the initial `.includes()` name match could wrongly resolve a
     *different*, still-disallowed course's error when one course's name is a
     substring of another's (real catalog prefix pairs exist, e.g. a course
     and its "- מעבדה" lab companion). Fixed with exact-name parsing
     (`parseDisallowedPlacedNameLocal`) instead of substring search.
   - Round 2: the resolution ran too early — right after the avoid
     post-filter, before later eligibility/degree-hours refills (which only
     exclude `unwantedCourseIds`, not hard-excludes) could silently re-add the
     exact flagged course from the elective pool. Fixed by checking the
     ACTUAL final placed course set (ground truth) after every repair/refill
     finishes, instead of a snapshot from one intermediate step.
   Final state: CI 3/3 green, Codex clean on the final commit, both review
   threads resolved with evidence, 8 regression tests (up from the initial 6),
   full API suite unaffected (1202/1202), full `jest.ui.config.js` suite at
   the same pre-existing fixture-gap baseline (386 failing out of 819, zero
   regressions), `tsc --noEmit` clean. Issue #28 closed. Classification: **C**
   (correctness/disclosure fix to an already-shipped feature).
4. Re-investigated issue #25 Finding #4 before picking a milestone: confirmed
   the previous session's conclusion still holds — a naive "cap goal-1's
   marginal near the target" mitigation only helps once the running total is
   close to the target minus remaining mandatory hours; it does NOT fix the
   general case (a large elective outranking a small mandatory course far from
   the target), which would require reordering/reweighting `GOAL_STACK`
   itself. Still a genuine design-tradeoff decision, not attempted this
   session either — picked issue #28 instead as the next item that doesn't
   require a product decision.

## Rolling A/B/C/D milestone history (most recent last)

1. PR #12 — Simulation capability — **D**
2. PR #13 — Persistence capability — **D**
3. PR #27 — hard-avoid plan correctness fix (Finding #1) — **C**
4. PR #31 — agent-path over-blocking fix (Finding #2) — **B**
5. PR #32 — max_weekly_hours disclosure fix (Finding #3) — **C**
6. PR #34 — client-side stale block-state fix, issue #28, merged (`19cb1e3`)
   after 2 rounds of real Codex findings fixed — **C**.
7. PR #36 — docs-only audit recap, merged (`b460f42`) — not classified (no
   product code).
8. PR #37 — `is_annual` course atomic multi-semester placement fix, **merged**
   (`c325eb6`) — **C** (correctness: prevents a real course's true weekly
   load from being silently under-reported, plus a latent state-corruption
   risk where an already-valid annual placement could be split during a
   routine rebuild).

Rolling-three checks:
- (12,13,27) = D/D/C — **NOT compliant** (only 1 of 3 is A/B/C; 0 are A/B).
  Pre-existing shortfall from before PR #27 existed — the exact gap issue #18
  already flagged as the reason PR #14 could not be merged as a 3rd D
  milestone. Not retroactively fixable; recorded as an acknowledged historical
  exception, not a compliant window.
- (13,27,31) = D/C/B — compliant (2 of 3 are A/B/C; 1 is A/B).
- (27,31,32) = C/B/C — compliant (3 of 3 are A/B/C; 1 is A/B).
- (31,32,34) = B/C/C — compliant (3 of 3 are A/B/C; 1 is A/B).
- (32,34,37) = C/C/C — **NOT compliant** (3 of 3 are A/B/C, but 0 are A/B —
  the rule requires at least one A/B per window). This was flagged
  prospectively by the prior session before #37 even merged, and now that
  it has, the window is real. **The next milestone MUST be an A or B**
  (user-visible, or wires an existing unconsumed capability — e.g. Decision,
  Simulation, or Persistence — into a real caller) to restore compliance,
  unless a genuinely higher-priority correctness issue is found first (P0/C
  correctness always preempts the rolling-window rule per this routine's own
  priority order).

Every merged window from PR #27 through PR #32/#34 is compliant; the one
non-compliant window before that predates PR #27 and could not be cured
after the fact (the reason #14 stayed held). (32,34,37) is now a SECOND,
current non-compliant window — unlike the first one, this one CAN still be
cured: the very next milestone selected should be A or B.

## Blockers

1. **Vercel deploy access** — see above. Everything merged so far (PR #12,
   #13, #27, #31, #32, #34, #37) is inert for real users until someone deploys
   `ui/frontend-modernization` HEAD. This is the single highest-value unblock
   available right now — real, tested, Codex-reviewed correctness fixes are
   sitting unshipped.
2. **Canonical branch reconciliation** (main rewrite / Vercel production-branch
   config, including the open question of which of the two Vercel projects —
   `tau-course-planner` (fastapi, currently serving prod) vs. `web` (nextjs,
   never successfully deployed to production) — is meant to be canonical) — a
   genuine human product decision, flagged multiple times in issue #18, not
   attempted unilaterally by any session including this one.
3. Issue #21 (dead code decision: delete or restore
   `requestPlanProposalFromDraft`/`runPrimaryAiAction`), issue #20 (386
   pre-existing UI test failures, single root cause: missing gitignored
   `supabase_board_backup_2027_pre_sync.json` fixture, needs a decision on
   whether a synthetic/sanitized fixture can replace it) — both need a human
   product call, already fully diagnosed, not blocking Agent-quality work.
4. Issue #25 Finding #4 — planner over-allocation (203h vs 185h target) — see
   milestone 4 above; needs a `GOAL_STACK` design decision before
   implementation, not just an approval to proceed.
5. Issue #25 Finding #5 — no server-side chat-vs-rebuild distinction. Assessed
   this session and **deprioritized, not just left pending**: `action_type`'s
   schema enum has no "chat" value, and the one real caller already never
   sends a rebuild request for a plain chat turn — a server-side gate would
   have zero reachable trigger path in production, i.e. an unused capability.
   Do not pick this up again without a concrete reason a real caller could
   hit it (e.g. a new client, or the field gaining a "chat" meaning).
6. PR #14 (Decision capability) remains open, deliberately unmerged — would be
   a 3rd consecutive D-classified milestone with no named production consumer.
   Recommend a human decide: close/park it as a reference implementation, or
   hold until a real multi-candidate producer exists to consume it. **This is
   also now the most obvious candidate production-consumer question for the
   next A/B milestone** (see Exact next action #1) — wiring Decision (or
   Simulation/Persistence) into a real caller would both resolve this blocker
   and satisfy the rolling-window B requirement in one milestone, IF a real
   multi-candidate producer can be justified by an actual Agent scenario
   (not manufactured just to consume the capability — that would violate
   "Do not build unused capabilities merely to advance an architectural
   checklist" from the other direction).

## Exact next action

1. **The rolling-three window (32,34,37) = C/C/C is non-compliant (0 A/B) —
   the next milestone MUST be classified A or B**, unless a new, genuinely
   higher-priority P0/correctness issue is found first (which always
   preempts). Before picking one:
   - Run the **Agent Diagnosis Loop** (real Hebrew scenarios against the now
     `is_annual`-fixed production-shaped `generate-plan` handler, both paths)
     to find the next highest-impact reproducible failure — a fresh B-class
     "wire an existing capability into a real caller" or A-class "user-visible
     fix" candidate may surface here that outranks anything listed below.
   - If nothing new surfaces, PR #14's Decision capability is the standing D
     candidate that could become a B if a genuine multi-candidate producer
     scenario exists — do not force this without a real scenario, per
     Blockers item 6's caveat.
2. **Whoever has Vercel CLI access: deploy `ui/frontend-modernization` HEAD to
   production.** Still the single most valuable pending action — 7 real,
   tested, Codex-reviewed fixes (PR #12, #13, #27, #31, #32, #34, #37) are
   merged and waiting, unchanged since the last several sessions all flagged
   this identically. Do not re-investigate this further without new evidence
   (e.g. Vercel CLI credentials becoming available) — the blocker and the
   reasoning against using `deploy_to_vercel` are both already fully
   documented above.
3. Issue #25 Finding #4 (planner over-allocation) still needs a human decision
   on the intended `GOAL_STACK` tradeoff before implementation — see Blockers.
   If a decision arrives, the recommended starting point is unchanged: a
   dedicated failing test reproducing the 203h/185h scenario (TDD RED), then
   treat the exact scoring mechanism as an open design question, and run the
   FULL planner test suite (`planner_goals.test.ts`, `planner_scorecard.test.ts`,
   `generate_plan_load_distribution_policy.test.ts`,
   `generate_plan_dual_semester_load_balance.test.ts` at minimum) before
   considering it done.
4. Finding #5 is deprioritized (see Blockers item 5) — do not resume it as
   "the next unblocked item" without a new reason it's reachable in production.
5. Issues #20/#21/#18(reconciliation)/#14 all still need a human product call
   — already fully diagnosed by prior sessions, not re-investigated further
   this session since nothing new was learned.
